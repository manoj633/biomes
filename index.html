		<h2>Desert subtitle</h2>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Deserts are very dry as there is little or no rainfall. They can be very hot or very cold. The plants and animals found in deserts have adapted to living in these conditions.They have very arid conditions of low precipitation and high evaporation, include plentiful mountains, plains, plateaus and canyons that include distinctive sub-varieties of desert landforms. These include gravel plains, sand dunes and dry lakebeds.
			Many natural factors are responsible for the creation of deserts,</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Many natural factors are responsible for the creation of deserts, particularly current and past climatic conditions. The Mojave Desert in California consists of 1.6 million acres of landscapes that changed over millions of years, including mountains, canyons, volcanic fields and dry lake basins. The region is within a great inland drainage basin where ancient lakes overflowed into adjacent valleys and eventually spilled into Death Valley. After the region dried up, it left dry lakebeds exposed to erosion by the wind.</p>

		<h3>Rainforest</h3>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Rainforests get a lot of rain. Most of them also get a lot of sunlight, and are very hot all year round. They are home to many different plants and animals. The largest rainforest is the tropical Amazon rainforest in South America.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Rainforest, luxuriant forest, generally composed of tall, broad-leaved trees and usually found in wet tropical uplands and lowlands around the Equator. Rainforests usually occur in regions where there is a high annual rainfall of generally more than 1,800 mm (70 inches) and a hot and steamy climate.</p>

			Wetlands

		<h3>Wetland</h3>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Wetlands are permanently flooded with water. This can be salt water, fresh water, or a mixture of both. Swamps, bogs, marshes, and deltas are all types of wetlands. Many birds thrive in this environment. Palustrine wetlands are nontidal wetlands. They occur in areas that were originally part of river or stream systems but have been cut off from a constant fresh flow of water. Poorly drained, they become marshes, swamps, bogs, potholes and fens. They may occur on a river terrace behind a levee or result from the changing course of a meandering river in a valley with a low gradient; abandoned channels may become marshes, ephemeral wetlands or swamps.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Palustrine wetlands also form in shallow, impervious, non-draining basins formed by the scouring and depositional action of glaciers. Fed by the seepage of groundwater, they may also form in bottomlands or depressions or along the lower slopes of hills where they merge with alluvial plains.Marine wetlands form along the coast in landforms such as shallow offshore reefs or along the shore in dune hollows and damp sand plains. They may also form in dune slacks or swales -- depressed areas between dune ridges that are replenished by rainfall or incursion by high tides -- or at the margins of lagoons and along the banks of tidal rivers and their associated flood plains.

			Decidious forests
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="dark">
		<h3>Deciduous forests</h3>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Deciduous forest is found in three middle-latitude regions with a temperate climate characterized by a winter season and year-round precipitation: eastern North America, western Eurasia, and northeastern Asia.The temperature and rainfall in decidious forests changes from season to season. During the autumn and winter, most trees change their colour and lose their leaves.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Animals in Deciduous Forests Have to Adapt to the Seasons to Survive. Deciduous forest also extends into more arid regions along stream banks and around bodies of water. Another name for these forests is broad-leaf forests because of the wide, flat leaves on the trees. Trees in tropical deciduous forests lose their leaves in the dry season and regrow them in the rainy season.</p>

			Grasslands
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="dark">
		<h3>Grasslands</h3>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Grasslands get little rainfall. Only grass and a few small trees and bushes can grow in these dry places. But many animals, such as zebras and elephants, manage to live there. Grasslands go by many names. In the U.S. Midwest, they're often called prairies. In South America, they're known as pampas. Central Eurasian grasslands are referred to as steppes, while African grasslands are savannas.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>What they all have in common are grasses, their naturally dominant vegetation. Grasslands are found where there is not enough regular rainfall to support the growth of a forest, but not so little that a desert forms. In fact, grasslands often lie between forests and deserts.Depending on how they’re defined, grasslands account for between 20 and 40 percent of the world's land area.</p>

			Coniferous forests

	<div class="dark">
		<h3>Coniferous forests</h3>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>These forests have long, cold, snowy winters and short, warm summers. Trees here have adapted to this harsh climate. They are mostly evergreen, meaning they stay green all year round. Mainly found in the cold and temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, the coniferous forest exists in an unbroken belt extending from the northern regions of Asia and Europe to northern United States, Canada, and Alaska.Rainforest, luxuriant forest, generally composed of </p>

			<p>tall, broad-leaved trees and usually found in wet tropical uplands and lowlands around the Equator. Rainforests usually occur in regions where there is a high annual rainfall of generally more than 1,800 mm (70 inches) and a hot and steamy climate.Commonly known as taiga or boreal forest, the coniferous region in the northern hemisphere is the largest terrestrial biome in the world. It can also be found in some regions of the southern hemisphere.</p>

			Tundra
		</div>

	<div class="dark">
		<h3>Tundra</h3>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>It is usually very cold and windy in the tundra, and there is not much rain. The ground is often covered in snow, so only a few plants and animals can live there.These forests are characterized by high and continuous rainfall, with annual rainfall in the case of tropical rainforests between 2.5 and 4.5 metres (98 and 177 in) and definitions varying by region for temperate rainforests.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Tundra ecosystems are treeless regions found in the Arctic and on the tops of mountains, where the climate is cold and windy, and rainfall is scant. Tundra lands are covered with snow for much of the year, but summer brings bursts of wildflowers.Mountain goats, sheep, marmots, and birds live in mountain—or alpine—tundra and feed on the low-lying plants and insects.</p>

			Polar Ice
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="dark">
		<h3>Polar Ice</h3>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>This is the coldest biome on Earth. The freezing temperature make it difiicult for any plants to survive. Animals, such as polar bears, Penguins, and seals, have adapted well to life here. Glaciers are giant masses of ice that form in polar regions and high mountains and flow over land like slow rivers.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p> A crevasse is a deep crack in the brittle surface of a glacier. A cirque is an amphitheater-shaped basin at the head of a glaciated valley. Huge, ancient ice sheets cover all but the highest mountain peaks of Greenland and Antarctica. Together these two massive landforms hold more than 75 percent of the world's fresh water.</p>

			Mountains
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="dark">
		<h3>Mountains</h3>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Mountains are high places with a cold, windy climate. It gets colder the higher up you go, so different groups plants ans animals are found at different heights. These landforms exhibit steep slopes and a relatively narrow summit. Vast uplifts of the Earth’s crust – referred to as upward folding – formed most of Earth’s mountain ranges. Volcanic accumulations of ash and lava formed others. There is no exact distinction between mountains and hills. However,</p>
		</div>
		<div class="two-col">
			<p> mountains are typically larger and steeper than hills.geologists believe most mountains are formed as the result of heat and pressure beneath the Earth's crust which causes movement and uplift in the crust. This movement is called plate tectonics, which also causes earthquakes. Though we cannot see most of them, there are more mountains in the ocean than on land. Some islands are the tops of underwater mountains. The Hawaiian Islands are an example of mountains formed by volcanism.</p>
